Scholars at the time had been examining individuals with extraordinary abilities and discovered that such abilities were activated through changes in the nature of their life force, which switched on non-coding genes.\N\NThis premise resulted in endless speculation on the part of Huolu scholars about the beginning of man and the Earth itself. Utilizing the phenomenological tool, they made interventions into the human body through energy manipulation, frequency resonance, electromagnetic radiation, and so on. It took them some time, through modifying the condition of life essence, to activate dormant genes.\N\NAlthough the thinkers managed to tap into human Potential, they never did succeed in completely deciphering the connection between life essence and genetic functioning. They could only record the phenomena that they observed and continue to update and refine what they had.\N\NThe theorists believed that the unfavorable and mysterious prehistoric environment forced living things to acquire exceptional survival characteristics at different times in order to avoid extinction or being preyed upon. These abilities were coded into their genes, but as the ages went by, natural selection shut them up.\N\NAt first, the Huolu civilization wanted to bestow upon the world the technology of Potential awakening. However, due to the advent of disaster, they lost this technology. Centuries later, by accident, Bai Yuekui rediscovered it.
